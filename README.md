# Analyzing-Industry-Carbon-Emissions
This project analyzes industry carbon emissions by examining product carbon footprints (PCFs) across multiple sectors using data publicly available on nature.com. Greenhouse gas emissions from manufacturing and transportation of consumer products account for over 75% of global emissions, making this analysis critical for understanding environmental impact. Using a PostgreSQL database containing the product_emissions table with data on product names, companies, countries, industry groups, weight, and carbon footprint measurements, the project explores carbon emissions across different production stages—upstream, operations, and downstream. The analysis covers diverse industries including Materials, Capital Goods, Technology Hardware & Equipment, Food & Beverage, and Professional Services, providing insights into which sectors contribute most to global carbon emissions and identifying opportunities for sustainability improvements across industries.​
